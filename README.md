Amigo 1985 WordPress Theme - a tribute to Amiga Workbench 1.0

This WordPress theme started as one of my school projects in 2011, and I wanted to share it.

* Terse documentation: I'm currently attending university and do not have all the time I want for all my projects, so I've put this Amiga theme on GitHub for all the fans who have encouraged me to do so (thank you for the moral support!).
* Please post other theme issues in the [project issue tracker](https://github.com/lizdizon/amigo1985/issues), and I welcome anyone to contribute to the project and make it a better theme!
